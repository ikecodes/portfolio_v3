    content="My name is Onuorah Emmanuel Ikechukwu and I enjoy building and making things work on the internet. My interest in software development started back in 2019 when I decided to try building a simple landing page from a youtube video I stumbled upon — making every UI element was so much fun and taught me alot!
Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at a number of companies. I've also had the opportunity to work on several projects as a freelancer.
I have gained strong experience building user friendly and accessible front-end for web and mobile applications using react and react native respectively. I also have good background in building solid and scalable back-end using Node.js" />
